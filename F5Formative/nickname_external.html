    <h2>How We Met</h2>
    <p><strong>We met during high school from another close friend of mine. Our friendship grew stronger over time as we spent time with our friend group and played games all night.
        As we reached Senior High School, I transferred to their school for more experience and our friendship grew even stronger until now.</strong><br>
