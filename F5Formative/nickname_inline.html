<h2>How We Met</h2>
    <p><strong>Our story started when there was an interaction between our schools, since he was in an all-boys school, while I studied in an all-girls Catholic School.
        Our friendship started when we talked during lunchtime and his classmates played a song for us during free time. He would ask to hang out with our group of friends,
        and over time, we became best of friends.</strong><br>
